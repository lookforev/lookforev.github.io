*So, Evan, why software engineering?*


Software engineering feels like the right fit for me.

Currently, I am an Infectious Disease Scientist.  As you can imagine, this has been an exciting time in my career.  The seven years I've been in healthcare have been led to this: a pandemic.  Lucky me!  However, within those seven years filled with field research, conference hopping, certification studying, and moving, I still had yet to find the missing puzzle piece to my lack of fulfillment in health information technology.  

The investigative work I do to solve medical mysteries is the same type of work I hope to do to understand computers and systems.  Yes, I am grateful to have a career.  Yes, I can cover my living expenses.  But I am not being challenged in ways that keep me yearning for more.

That is the reason I decided to study informatics: for the up and coming ways technologies would be used to transform healthcare.  The health aspect of this is secure, but now is the time for me to focus on the hardcore software part.  Learning ways to incorporate software engineering and saving lives has come to a quotidian task for me now.  Even if it is yet to merge, I admire the logic it takes to understand the details to create apps and software for the world to use.

Who knows what this boot camp will provide me?  Maybe I'll discover a new exciting field for me to become an investigator.  Perhaps I may stumble across an innovative way to perform epidemiological work with software.  For most people, the uncertainty of diving into this boot camp as a growing professional would be dismayed: but I am fully embracing it.  I cannot wait to see what the next few months have in store for me and my cohort.

Again, software engineering feels like the right fit for me.
